You'll use Puppet's declarative language to describe the desired state of your system in files called manifests.
 Manifests describe how your network and operating system resources, such as files, packages, and services,
  should be configured. Puppet then compiles those manifests into catalogs, which across your infrastructure.

Setting up Puppet (Master/Slave)

Master Settings

    - apt-get install wget
    - wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet-release-bionic.deb
    - dpkg -i puppet-release-bionic.deb
    - apt-get install puppetmaster
    - systemctl status puppet-master.service
    - vim /etc/default/puppet-master
        -- JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512 -Xmx512"
    - systemctl restart puppet-master.service
     ufw allow 8140/tcp


     Restart puppetmaster after the change

Slave Settings
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install wget
    - wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet-release-bionic.deb
    - dpkg -i puppet-release-bionic.deb
    - apt-get install puppet
    - systemctl start puppet
    - systemctl enable puppet

On master
    puppet cert list ------------------ list or view puppet agent cert
    puppet cert sign --all ------------ sign all cert

Manifest - a collection of resource declarations, using the extension .pp
Three Component
    - Variables
    - Loops
    - Conditions
Manifests are a basic building block of Puppet and are kept in a specific file structure called a module.
Creating Maninfest
     mkdir -p /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests
     create (file site.pp)

site.pp file content
    node_default{
        package { 'nginx':
            ensure => installed,
        }
        file {'/tmp/status.txt':
            content => 'Nginx installed'
            mode => '0644'
        }
    }

puppet code basic sample
    package { 'nginx'
        ensure => 'installed'
    }
